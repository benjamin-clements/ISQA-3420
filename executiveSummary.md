# Executive Summary

  *.. The issue with the modern system is that there are no proficient ways of a developer and a manager tracking how a developed software package with licenses and vulnerabilities. Currently, the system misguides on who is supposed to check the software package and then who is supposed to get the requested results. At the same time, there is no direction as far as the results being used to update, or even create, policies for the corporation. 
  
  *.. This new system will let the developer focus more on the development of the system, but still have access to check the results of the submitted software package. Once the software package is sent to be checked by the license scanner and then the NIST Vulnerability database, the information is sent to the Licensed Software database. From this point, the results of the scans can be checked by the developer and the manager. The manager can use the results to build upon or update current policies, and if need be, be able to create a new policy.
